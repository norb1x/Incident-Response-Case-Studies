# Cybersecurity Case Studies Portfolio

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity case study repository.

This repository contains incident analysis reports and network forensics
investigations that I have worked on in the past. Each case study
represents a structured analysis of a simulated or reconstructed
security incident, focusing on technical investigation, traffic
analysis, and attack chain reconstruction.

All reports are written in a professional incident response format and
are sanitized for public release.
