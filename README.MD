# Cybersecurity Case Studies Portfolio

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity case study repository.

This repository contains incident analysis reports and network forensics
investigations that I have worked on in the past. Each case study
represents a structured analysis of a simulated or reconstructed
security incident, focusing on technical investigation, traffic
analysis, and attack chain reconstruction.

These reports reflect my personal learning process in incident analysis and network forensics. All content is sanitized for public release.
